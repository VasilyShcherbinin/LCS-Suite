Description: Manages the logistical aspects of balance accuracy calculations which can handle unbalanced datasets, and/or datasets with multiple discrete classes.

LCS: Educational Learning Classifier System - A basic LCS coded for educational purposes.  This LCS algorithm uses supervised learning, and thus is most
similar to "UCS", an LCS algorithm published by Ester Bernado-Mansilla and Josep Garrell-Guiu (2003) which in turn is based heavily on "XCS", an LCS 
algorithm published by Stewart Wilson (1995).
